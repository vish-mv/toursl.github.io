            <h2>Polonaruwa</h2>
            <p>Polonnaruwa is a city in Sri Lanka known for its ancient ruins and historic significance.
                 The city served as the second capital of the country after the fall of Anuradhapura, 
                 and was ruled by several Sri Lankan kings during the 11th to 13th centuries. The ruins 
                 of Polonnaruwa include the Royal Palace, Council Chamber, Gal Vihara, and various temples 
                 and stupas, which provide a glimpse into the country's rich history and cultural heritage. 
                 Polonnaruwa is also home to the Parakrama Samudra, a vast man-made reservoir constructed in 
                 the 12th century, and serves as an important source of irrigation for the surrounding areas. 
                 Today, Polonnaruwa remains a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the 
                 world to experience its fascinating history and stunning archaeological sites.</p>
